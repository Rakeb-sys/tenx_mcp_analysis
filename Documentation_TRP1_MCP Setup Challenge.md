TRP 1 - MCP Setup Challenge

Task 1:  Setup 

As per the Instruction, I have connected to MCP Analysis Server with VSCode.

I was trying to create a folder in VSCode and connect it to my git. But when i checked for the created folder on git, it was not there. Therefore, I initially create it from the browser and clone it to my VScode.

The main challenge was that the Add Server button was not working properly. However I input the whole json code and saved it. 
Then the Server gave response by its own and displayed the start option.
