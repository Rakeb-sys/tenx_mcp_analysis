TRP 1 - MCP Setup Challenge

Task 1:  Setup 

As per the Instruction, I have connected to MCP Analysis Server with VSCode.

The main challenge was that the Add Server button was not working properly. However I input the whole json code and saved it. 
Then the Server gave response by its own and displayed the start option.
